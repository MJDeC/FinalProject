Week 14 Program #2: Final Project Pseudocode

In main function:
  Connect to database, get cursor, and add table.
  Call function that actually does stuff.

In function that actually does stuff:
  Get rid of table if it already exists, and create the table.
  There will be a database with at least seven fields.
  In loop:
    Display the data in the database, and give the user an option to choose which item they'd like to edit.
    Ask the user if they'd like to edit anymore information. If yes, re-iterate loop. If no, continue.

  Display final contents of the database.
